# word-search

this is my version of a word search.
i am making this because i want fun word searches to play.
my favorite existing version is [here](https://word-search-puzzles.appspot.com/).
my problem with it is that the word searches are pre-made, so that i end up with repeats, and that the timer can't be paused.

i have fixed the first of these.
i am working on the second one.
unfortunately, fixing the first problem means that more problems arise.
for example, you might wonder why the timer is where it is.
it is there because i do not know how to move it.
you might also wonder why filling in diagonal words is so ugly.
i'm sure there are other things you are wondering, but truthfully it is past my bedtime.

will these problems be fixed?
that is for us to ask, and for us to never know.

or i will get my shit together and then we can all stop asking.

run with ```flask run```.
this is actually why i've typed this all.
because i already know that in three years' time i will want to play some word searches, but i won't know how to run this thing.
